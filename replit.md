## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Authentication Strategy

**Optimal Signup/Login Process:**
1. **Customer Registration**: All new users register as 'customer' by default
2. **Admin Role Assignment**: Admin promotes users to 'driver' or 'admin' roles as needed
3. **Role-Based Redirects**: Users are automatically redirected to appropriate dashboards:
   - Customers â†’ /dashboard (booking and subscription management)
   - Drivers â†’ /driver (route management and pickup completion)
   - Admins â†’ /admin (user management, pickup assignment, business overview)
4. **Landing Page**: Unauthenticated users see marketing page with Sign In/Get Started buttons
