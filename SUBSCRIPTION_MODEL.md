# $20/Month Subscription Model

## How Weekly Pickup Subscriptions Work

### **Customer Experience:**
1. **Sign up for $20/month** (billed automatically via Stripe)
2. **Get 4-5 weekly pickups** depending on the month
3. **Request pickup when needed** (no fixed schedule)
4. **Priority placement** in driver's daily route optimization
5. **Standard bag limits** (3-5 bags typical)

### **Driver Workflow:**
1. **Subscription customers show as "priority"** in route planning
2. **Weekly pickup tracking** ensures each subscriber gets service
3. **Revenue predictability** - $20 guaranteed per subscriber monthly
4. **Route priority** - subscriptions processed before one-time requests

### **Business Model Benefits:**

**Predictable Revenue:**
- 50 subscribers = $1,000/month guaranteed income
- One-time pickups = additional revenue on top
- Reduces income uncertainty

**Customer Retention:**
- Convenient automatic billing
- Priority service encourages loyalty
- Lower per-pickup cost vs one-time ($5/pickup vs $10-25)

**Route Efficiency:**
- Regular customers create predictable demand patterns
- Subscription density in neighborhoods improves route optimization
- Builds customer relationships and referrals

### **Pricing Strategy:**

**Subscription Value:**
- $20/month รท 4 weeks = $5 per pickup
- Compare to one-time: $10-25 per pickup
- 50-75% savings motivates subscription sign-ups

**Revenue Comparison:**
- **Subscriber**: $20/month (4 pickups) = $5 per stop
- **One-time**: $15 average = $15 per stop
- **Immediate**: $25-35 = premium pricing

### **Implementation Features:**
