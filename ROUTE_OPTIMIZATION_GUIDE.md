# Route Optimization Flow for Single-Driver Philly Metro Operation

## **Daily Workflow (Most Realistic for Your Friend)**

### **Morning Planning (9-10 AM) - 10 minutes:**
1. **Driver opens admin dashboard**
2. **Reviews accumulated requests** from past 24-48 hours
3. **Clicks "Optimize Today's Route"** - system processes:
   - **Subscription pickups** (priority queue)
   - **Next-day packages** (standard priority)
   - **Same-day requests** (premium priority)
4. **Gets optimized route** with 5-8 stops clustered by area

### **Route Execution (10 AM - 3 PM) - 5 hours:**
1. **Mobile driver dashboard** shows sequence
2. **One-click Google Maps** navigation between stops
3. **Photo + complete** workflow at each stop
4. **Automatic customer notifications**

## **Geographic Optimization for Philly Metro**

### **Area-Based Clustering:**
- **Monday**: Center City + South Philly (8-10 stops)
- **Tuesday**: Delaware County suburbs (5-7 stops)
- **Wednesday**: Montgomery County (5-7 stops)
- **Thursday**: North Philly + Kensington (6-8 stops)
- **Friday**: Flex day for same-day requests + catchup

### **Route Efficiency Strategy:**
- **Urban areas**: Tight clusters, minimal drive time
- **Suburban areas**: Fewer stops but higher average value
- **Bridge traffic**: Separate South Jersey into specific days
- **Target**: $200-400 daily revenue regardless of area

## **Priority System (How Requests Get Ordered)**

### **1. Subscription Customers (Highest Priority)**
- **Weekly pickup guarantee**
- **Processed first** in route optimization

- **$25-35 pricing** justifies route adjustments
- **Added to existing route** or separate premium run

### **3. Next-Day Standard**

- **$10-15 pricing** for standard service
- **Fills remaining route capacity**
