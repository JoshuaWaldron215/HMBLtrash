Redesign the admin dashboard for "Acapella Trash powered by HMBL" with the goal of improving clarity, organization, and manual control over all pickups.

---

🧼 GENERAL CLEANUP:
- Reduce visual noise and remove unused stats like total revenue per transaction (it's confusing)
- Use fewer bright colors and more soft accents
- Group related items into collapsible sections or tabs (e.g., Subscribers, Requests, Routes)

---

📆 SUBSCRIBER MANAGEMENT (NEW PAGE OR TAB):
- Show a clean table or card list of all active subscribers:
  - Columns: Name, Address, Subscription Status, Assigned Day (e.g. Monday), Bag Count
  - Include "Edit" icon on each row to:
    - Change their assigned pickup day (dropdown: Mon–Fri)
    - Update bag count or pause subscription
- Add filters by day (e.g. “Show all Tuesday pickups”)
- Add a bulk assign tool: select multiple subscribers and assign to a pickup day

---

📦 ONE-TIME REQUESTS PAGE:
- Keep “Same-Day” and “Next-Day” tabs, but also add:
  - Filter by Assigned / Unassigned
  - Column for Assigned Driver (with dropdown to change)
  - Column for Assigned Day (with dropdown: Mon–Sun)
- Add status badges: `Assigned`, `Unassigned`, `Urgent`
- Allow quick action buttons:
  - “Assign Driver”
  - “Unassign”
  - “Mark Completed”

---

📍 ROUTE OPTIMIZATION PAGE:
- Keep "Optimize Subscription Route" and "Optimize Package Route" buttons
- Below that, add:
  - A multi-select dropdown or checkbox list of addresses
  - When selected, calculate optimized route using Google Maps API
  - Show output as ordered list: 1 → 2 → 3 with total drive time
  - Include “View on Map” button next to result
- Optional: Show estimated total revenue for selected route

---

🧭 TODAY’S ROUTES (MOVE THIS TO ITS OWN TAB OR PAGE):
- Split view into: "Today’s Assigned Pickups" and "Unassigned Pickups"
- Use table or card layout with:
  - Stop number
  - Address
  - Driver
  - Day
  - Type: Subscription / One-Time
  - Status (Scheduled, Completed, Missed)
- Optional: “Reassign” or “Edit Pickup” modal on each card

---

🧩 SIDEBAR STRUCTURE (Update Navigation):
- Dashboard
- 📅 Assigned Pickups (new view with filters)
- 🧍 Subscribers
- 📦 One-Time Requests
- 📍 Route Optimization
- 🚚 Driver Assignments (optional — to manage driver profiles)
- 📊 Pickup Reports
- ⚙️ Settings

Keep design clean and easy to read with Tailwind:
- Use consistent spacing, soft card shadows, hover interactions
- Reduce overuse of badges unless actionable
- Use icons only where helpful (calendar, location, bag count)
