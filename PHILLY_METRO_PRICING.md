## Geographic Considerations

### **Route Optimization by Area:**

- **Suburbs (Delco/Montco)**: Spread out, fewer stops per route
- **South Jersey**: Separate route days due to bridge traffic

### **Service Efficiency:**
- **Urban areas**: 8-10 stops per route
- **Suburban areas**: 5-7 stops per route
- **Target daily revenue**: $200-400 regardless of area

This pricing model maximizes revenue while staying competitive with traditional waste management companies ($30-50/month) and provides flexible options for different customer needs across the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
