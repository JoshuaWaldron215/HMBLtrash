# Collaboration Database Issue Troubleshooting

## Problem: Collaborator's account not syncing to shared database

### Your Database Status ‚úÖ
- Connected to shared Neon PostgreSQL database
- 3 test accounts exist (admin, driver, customer)
- Database operations working correctly

### Issue Diagnosis üîç
Your collaborator's new account registration is **not appearing** in the shared database, which means:

1. **They're using a different DATABASE_URL** (most likely)
2. **Environment not configured** properly on their end
3. **Connection issues** to the shared database

### Solution Steps for Your Collaborator:

#### Step 1: Verify DATABASE_URL
They need to check their environment variables:
```bash
echo $DATABASE_URL
```
Should match your DATABASE_URL exactly.

#### Step 2: Add Shared DATABASE_URL
In their Replit environment, they need to add the secret:
1. Go to Secrets (lock icon in sidebar)
2. Add key: `DATABASE_URL`
3. Add value: `[YOUR_SHARED_DATABASE_URL]`

#### Step 3: Restart Their Application
After adding the DATABASE_URL:
1. Stop their server
2. Restart with `npm run dev`
3. Check the logs for database connection

#### Step 4: Test Connection
They can verify by checking user count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```
Should return 3 (or 4 if test account was created).

### Quick Test Account Created ‚úÖ
I've created a test account for verification:
- **Email**: collab@test.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Role**: customer

Try logging in with this account. If it works, the database is shared correctly.

### Next Steps:
1. Test the collab@test.com account
2. Share the exact DATABASE_URL with your collaborator
3. Have them verify environment setup
4. Restart both applications after confirming same DATABASE_URL

The collaboration setup should work once both devices use the same DATABASE_URL.
